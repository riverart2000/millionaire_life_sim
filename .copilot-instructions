# Copilot Coding Directives

- Write clean, modular, and efficient code (follow SOLID principles).
- Optimize for performance and low memory use; avoid redundancy.
- Enforce input validation, error handling, and security by default.
- Add minimal, clear docstrings and meaningful names.
- Keep functions small and reusable; separate logic layers.
- Prefer async, streaming, and caching when possible.
- Include unit tests and mocks for all public methods.
- Use structured logging with safe, configurable debug levels.
- Avoid hard-coded secrets or magic numbers.
- Design for cross-platform and easy future refactoring.
