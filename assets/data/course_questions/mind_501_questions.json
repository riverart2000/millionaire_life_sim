      "options": [
        "Never experiencing setbacks",
        "The ability to recover quickly from difficulties and adapt to challenges",
        "Being stubborn",
        "Avoiding all problems"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Resilience is the capacity to bounce back from adversity, adapt to change, and keep going despite setbacks. It's not about avoiding failure - it's about how quickly you recover. Resilient people view challenges as temporary, focus on what they can control, and extract lessons from every setback."

      "id": "mind_501_q2",
      "text": "What is the 'locus of control' and why does it matter?",
      "options": [
        "A meditation technique",
        "Your belief about whether you control events (internal) or external forces control them (external)",
        "A management style",
        "A type of therapy"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Internal locus of control: believing your actions determine outcomes. External: believing luck, fate, others control your life. Successful people have strong internal locus - they take responsibility for results and believe their actions matter. This drives proactive behavior and persistence through obstacles."

      "text": "What is 'antifragile' according to Nassim Taleb?",
      "options": [
        "Fragile but pretending to be strong",
        "Beyond resilient - systems that gain from disorder, stress, and volatility",
        "Against fragility",
        "A type of glass"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Antifragile goes beyond resilience. Fragile things break under stress. Resilient things withstand stress. Antifragile things improve from stress. Example: muscles grow stronger from workout stress. Build antifragility by: embracing small failures, diversifying, building optionality, having skin in the game."

      "options": [
        "Seeking unnecessary pain",
        "Major breakthroughs often emerge from navigating challenges - adversity reveals and develops character",
        "Complaining about problems",
        "Avoiding all difficulty"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The principle: your greatest growth occurs during/after your biggest challenges. Adversity reveals your true character, forces innovation, and builds mental toughness. Many successful people credit their struggles as catalysts for breakthrough. Ask: 'What is this teaching me?' and 'How am I growing stronger?'"

      "options": [
        "Making excuses for yourself",
        "Treating yourself with kindness during failure/difficulty - crucial for sustained performance and recovery",
        "Being lazy and self-indulgent",
        "Ignoring problems"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-compassion is treating yourself with the same kindness you'd show a friend during struggles. Research shows it increases resilience, reduces anxiety, and leads to better performance than harsh self-criticism. Components: self-kindness (vs self-judgment), common humanity (everyone struggles), mindfulness (vs over-identification)."
