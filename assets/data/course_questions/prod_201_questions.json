      "options": [
        "Working underground",
        "Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit",
        "Physical labor",
        "Working overtime"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Deep Work is focused, uninterrupted work on cognitively demanding tasks. Opposite of 'shallow work' (email, admin, meetings). Deep work: (1) Produces valuable output, (2) Improves skills, (3) Is hard to replicate. In 4 hours of deep work, you can accomplish more than 8 hours of fragmented work. Schedule deep work blocks when energy is highest."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Flow (Mihály Csíkszentmihályi) is optimal experience where: (1) Challenge matches skill level, (2) Clear goals exist, (3) Immediate feedback present, (4) Full concentration engaged. In flow, performance is 500% higher. Triggers: eliminate distractions, clear goals, slightly difficult tasks, uninterrupted time. Athletes call it 'the zone.'"

      "options": [
        "Leftover attention at day's end",
        "When switching tasks, part of your attention remains stuck on the previous task, reducing performance",
        "Eye strain",
        "Memory loss"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Attention residue (Sophie Leroy): when you switch tasks, your attention doesn't fully shift - part remains on the previous task. This significantly reduces performance on the new task. Solution: (1) Time-blocking - complete tasks before switching, (2) Transition rituals - clear mental palate, (3) Batch similar tasks. Minimize task switching for peak productivity."

        "Creating vs delegating",
        "Morning vs afternoon"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Paul Graham's concept: Maker time (programmers, writers, designers) needs 3-4 hour uninterrupted blocks for deep work. Manager time works in 30-60 minute blocks for meetings/calls. Conflict arises when managers schedule 30-minute meetings during makers' deep work blocks - destroys productivity. Batch meetings; protect maker time."
