        "Aggressive closing techniques",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Consultative selling focuses on understanding the customer's business, challenges, and goals before recommending solutions. You're a problem-solver, not a product pusher.

      "options": [
        "They're the same thing",
        "Features describe what a product is/does; benefits explain how it improves the customer's life",
        "Features are for marketing, benefits for sales",
        "Benefits are always price-related"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Features are product attributes: '1TB storage, 12-hour battery, titanium frame.' Benefits answer 'So what?' and connect to emotions/outcomes: 'Never delete photos' (1TB), 'Work unplugged all day' (battery), 'Lasts a lifetime' (titanium). People buy benefits, not features. Always translate features into benefits."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "SPIN (Neil Rackham): (1) Situation questions - understand current state, (2) Problem questions - identify difficulties, (3) Implication questions - explore consequences of problems, (4) Need-payoff questions - get them to articulate value of solving it. The prospect talks themselves into buying by recognizing their own needs."

      "options": [
        "Showing your social media followers",
        "Evidence that others have chosen and benefited from your solution - testimonials, case studies, reviews",
        "Proving you're social",
        "Social media marketing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Social proof leverages the psychological principle that people follow others' actions. Types: testimonials, case studies, reviews, logos of big clients, user counts, awards. Reduces perceived risk. Example: 'Over 10,000 businesses trust us' or 'Apple uses our software.' Especially powerful when proof comes from similar customers."
