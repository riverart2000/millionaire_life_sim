      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Outcome goal: 'Lose 30 pounds.' Process goal: 'Exercise 4x weekly and eat 5 servings of vegetables daily.' Outcome goals define success; process goals define behavior. Millionaires focus on process - control the inputs (daily actions), and outcomes follow naturally."

It signals importance and triggers your subconscious to seek opportunities. Studies show written goals are 42% more likely to be achieved than unwritten ones. Review them daily."
