      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Tax-advantaged accounts like 401(k), IRA, Roth IRA offer tax benefits. Traditional accounts give upfront tax deductions and tax-deferred growth.

        "They're the same thing",
        "Deduction reduces taxable income; credit directly reduces tax owed dollar-for-dollar",
        "Deductions are illegal, credits are legal",
        "Credits are only for businesses"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Tax deductions reduce your taxable income (if you're in 25% bracket, $1,000 deduction saves $250). Tax credits reduce your tax bill dollar-for-dollar ($1,000 credit saves $1,000). Credits are more valuable than deductions of the same amount."

        "A type of home renovation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "High earners often can't contribute directly to Roth IRAs due to income limits. The backdoor Roth involves making non-deductible traditional IRA contributions, then immediately converting to Roth IRA. This legal strategy allows high earners to benefit from Roth's tax-free growth."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Depreciation allows property owners to deduct the cost of income-producing property over 27.5 years (residential) or 39 years (commercial). This creates a 'paper loss' that reduces taxable income without actual cash outflow, significantly lowering tax burden on rental income."
