      "explanation": "The OODA Loop (John Boyd): (1) Observe - gather information, (2) Orient - analyze and synthesize data, (3) Decide - determine action, (4) Act - implement. Then loop back. Faster OODA loops than competitors create advantage. Used in military, business, and crisis management for rapid, adaptive decisions."

      "options": [
        "A medical condition",
        "Overthinking decisions leads to no decision - overcome with deadlines, 80% rule, and accepting imperfect information",
        "Analyzing too little",
        "Being paralyzed physically"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Analysis paralysis occurs when overthinking prevents decision-making. Combat it with: (1) Set decision deadlines, (2) Apply 80/20 rule - decide with 80% of info, (3) Accept you'll never have perfect data, (4) Make reversible decisions quickly, (5) Remember not deciding is still a decision - often the worst one."

        "A funeral planning session",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A pre-mortem imagines your decision has catastrophically failed. Ask: 'What went wrong?' Team members identify potential failure points you might have missed. This uncovers blind spots, reduces overconfidence, and improves decisions. More effective than typical 'what could go wrong?' because it assumes failure already happened."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Jeff Bezos's framework: When facing big decisions, project yourself to age 80 looking back. Will you regret not trying? Most people regret inaction more than failed attempts. This long-term perspective cuts through short-term fears and clarifies what truly matters."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Second-order thinking asks 'And then what?' repeatedly. First-order: 'This deal increases revenue!' Second-order: 'But it requires hiring 50 people, straining culture and cash flow, potentially destroying what made us successful.' Great leaders think 3-4 moves ahead like chess players."
