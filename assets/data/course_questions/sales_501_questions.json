      "options": [
        "Win at all costs",
        "Seek win-win outcomes where both parties feel they've gained value",
        "Take advantage of the other party",
        "Never compromise"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Win-win negotiation (principled negotiation) creates mutual value rather than dividing a fixed pie. Both parties' interests are satisfied. This builds long-term relationships and repeat business. Contrast with win-lose (one party dominates) which breeds resentment. Focus on interests (why they want it), not positions (what they're demanding)."

      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "BATNA (Roger Fisher) is your best alternative if this negotiation fails. Knowing your BATNA gives you power - you'll only accept deals better than your alternative. Example: Job negotiation with $80K BATNA (another offer) - you won't accept less than $85K. Always know your BATNA and try to improve it before negotiating. Also, understand their BATNA."

        "Being stubborn",
        "Using boat analogies"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "In negotiation, the first number mentioned (anchor) disproportionately influences the final outcome. Research shows negotiations cluster around the anchor. Strategy: Make the first offer when you have good information about fair value. Anchor high when selling, low when buying. If they anchor unreasonably, reset with a counter-anchor backed by market data."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Mirroring (Chris Voss, FBI negotiator) repeats their last 1-3 words with an upward inflection. Them: 'This price is too high.' You: 'Too high?' Them: [explains their reasoning]. It: (1) Encourages elaboration, (2) Builds rapport, (3) Buys thinking time, (4) Shows you're listening. Simple but powerful for uncovering hidden information and objections."

      "options": [
        "Wastes time",
        "Creates pressure for the other party to fill the void, often revealing valuable information or making concessions",
        "Shows you're not listening",
        "Means you've lost"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Most people are uncomfortable with silence and rush to fill it - often revealing information or making concessions. After making your offer or asking a question, stay silent. Let them break the silence. Discipline yourself not to rescue them. The first person to speak after a proposal often loses. Silence is a negotiation power move."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The nibble asks for extras after agreement: 'Great, we have a deal! By the way, can you include shipping?' People are more likely to give small concessions after committing to the big deal. Defense: recognize it ('Nice nibble!'), tie it to something ('I can include shipping if you pay within 10 days'), or simply say no graciously."
