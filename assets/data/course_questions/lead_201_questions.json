EQ predicts leadership success better than IQ."

      "text": "What is 'self-awareness' and why is it foundational for leadership?",
      "options": [
        "Being selfish",
        "Understanding your emotions, strengths, weaknesses, values, and impact on others",
        "Looking in mirrors often",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Self-awareness is recognizing your emotional patterns, triggers, strengths, blind spots, and how you affect others. It's the foundation of EQ. Without it, you can't regulate emotions or empathize. Develop it through: reflection, feedback seeking, journaling, and personality assessments."

      "text": "What is 'active listening'?",
      "options": [
        "Hearing words only",
        "Fully concentrating, understanding, responding, and remembering what's being said - listening to understand, not reply",
        "Waiting for your turn to talk",
        "Agreeing with everything"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Active listening means giving full attention, showing engagement (eye contact, nodding), asking clarifying questions, and reflecting back what you heard. Goal: truly understand before responding. Most people listen to reply, not understand. Leaders who master this build trust and solve problems effectively."

      "options": [
        "Hiding all emotions",
        "Managing your emotional responses appropriately rather than being controlled by them - crucial for decision-making and team morale",
        "Always being happy",
        "Never feeling emotions"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Emotional regulation means experiencing emotions fully but choosing your response rather than reacting impulsively. Leaders face high stress - poor regulation leads to reactive decisions, damaged relationships, and toxic culture. Techniques: pause before responding, name the emotion, reframe situations, use breathing exercises."
