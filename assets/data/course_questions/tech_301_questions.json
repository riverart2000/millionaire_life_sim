      "options": [
        "Most Valuable Player",
        "The simplest version of a product that solves the core problem - used to test assumptions with real users",
        "A complete product with all features",
        "The most expensive version"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "MVP is the leanest version of your product that delivers core value. Goal: test your hypothesis with minimal resources before building the full product. Example: Airbnb's MVP was a simple website with photos of their apartment. MVP prevents wasting resources on features users don't want."

      "options": [
        "Having a product that fits in the market",
        "When your product satisfies strong market demand - customers can't live without it",
        "Matching colors to brand",
        "Pricing correctly"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Product-market fit means you've built something people desperately want. Signals: organic growth, high retention, customers upset if product disappeared, natural word-of-mouth. Marc Andreessen: 'You can always feel when product-market fit isn't happening.' Before fit: iterate quickly. After fit: scale aggressively."

      "options": [
        "B2B is better than B2C",
        "B2B sells to businesses with longer sales cycles and higher values; B2C sells to consumers with shorter cycles and lower values",
        "Both are the same",
        "B2B is only for technology"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "B2B (Business-to-Business): sell to companies, longer sales cycles, higher contract values, relationship-driven, ROI-focused. B2C (Business-to-Consumer): sell to individuals, shorter cycles, lower values, emotion-driven, volume-focused. Each requires different marketing, sales, and product strategies."

      "options": [
        "How fast employees work",
        "Monthly cash spent exceeding revenue - indicates how long the company can survive",
        "Calories burned at work",
        "Office temperature"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Burn rate is monthly cash outflow minus inflow. If you have $1M and burn $100K/month, you have 10 months of runway. Critical metric for fundraising and survival. High burn requires either: (1) Reaching profitability quickly, (2) Raising more capital, or (3) Reducing expenses. Many startups die from running out of cash."

        "Giving up",
        "Dancing move"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A pivot is a structured course correction to test a new hypothesis about your product/business model. Famous pivots: Twitter started as Odeo (podcasting), Instagram started as Burbn (check-in app), YouTube started as video dating site. Pivoting isn't failure - it's learning. The vision persists; the strategy evolves."

      "options": [
        "IPO → Series A → Seed → Series B",
        "Seed → Series A → Series B → Series C → IPO/Exit",
        "Only one round of funding",
        "Bank loans only"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Typical VC stages: (1) Seed ($500K-$2M) - prove concept, (2) Series A ($2-15M) - prove product-market fit, (3) Series B ($10-50M) - scale operations, (4) Series C+ - expand markets/prepare exit. Each round dilutes founders but provides capital for growth. Not all startups raise VC - bootstrapping is valid."
