      "options": [
        "Robots that look human",
        "Computer systems that can perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence - learning, reasoning, problem-solving",
        "Advanced calculators",
        "Science fiction only"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "AI is technology that enables computers to simulate human intelligence - understanding language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, learning from experience. Types: Narrow AI (specific tasks like chess, image recognition), General AI (human-level intelligence across domains - not yet achieved)."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Machine Learning is a subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data rather than following explicit rules. Types: Supervised learning (labeled data), Unsupervised learning (find patterns), Reinforcement learning (learn from feedback). Used in: recommendations, fraud detection, self-driving cars, medical diagnosis."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "AI business applications: (1) Automation - free humans for strategic work, (2) Analytics - uncover patterns humans miss, (3) Personalization - tailor experiences at scale, (4) Prediction - forecast trends and behavior, (5) Optimization - improve operations continuously. Start small, scale what works."

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Prompt engineering is the skill of writing inputs that produce desired AI outputs. Good prompts are: clear, specific, contextual, and iterative. Example: Instead of 'Write marketing copy,' try 'Write 3 Instagram captions for eco-friendly water bottles targeting fitness enthusiasts, include emojis and call-to-action.' Skills become more valuable as AI adoption grows."

        "AI has no risks",
        "Computers becoming too smart"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "AI risks include: (1) Bias - inherits prejudices from training data, (2) Privacy - handling sensitive data, (3) Job displacement - need reskilling strategies, (4) Security - AI systems can be hacked/manipulated, (5) Over-reliance - humans must oversee critical decisions. Responsible AI requires addressing these proactively."
