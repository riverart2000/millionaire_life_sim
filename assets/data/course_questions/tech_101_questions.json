      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of records (blocks) linked cryptographically. Each block contains transaction data, timestamp, and link to previous block. It's decentralized (no single authority), transparent, and virtually tamper-proof. Bitcoin runs on blockchain, but blockchain has many other uses."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A crypto wallet stores private keys (like passwords) that prove ownership of your crypto. Hot wallets (online) are convenient but less secure. Cold wallets (offline hardware) are more secure. Remember: 'Not your keys, not your crypto' - keeping coins on exchanges means you don't truly own them."

      "options": [
        "Share your private keys with everyone",
        "Never share your private keys or seed phrase with anyone - they give complete access to your funds",
        "Keep everything on exchanges",
        "Use simple passwords"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Your private key/seed phrase is like the master key to your bank vault. If someone gets it, they own your crypto - transactions are irreversible. Never: (1) Share it with anyone (no legitimate service asks), (2) Store it digitally, (3) Take photos of it. Write it down, store securely offline. Crypto transfers are permanent."
