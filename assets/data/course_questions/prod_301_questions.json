        "Dumping all your work on others",
        "Transfer both responsibility and authority - empower others to own outcomes, not just tasks",
        "Micromanaging every detail",
        "Never delegating anything important"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Effective delegation gives both the task AND the authority to complete it. Don't just delegate tasks ('do this'); delegate outcomes ('achieve this result however you see fit'). Provide: (1) Clear desired outcome, (2) Context/constraints, (3) Authority to make decisions, (4) Resources needed, (5) Check-in schedule. Then step back. Micromanaging isn't delegation."

        "Billing clients"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Ask: 'Is this a $10/hour activity (admin, scheduling, data entry) or $1000/hour activity (strategy, relationship building, high-level decisions)?' Successful people relentlessly focus on high-value activities and delegate/automate the rest. Track your time for a week. Any $10/hour work you're doing? Delegate it. Your time is your scarcest resource."

      "options": [
        "A video game assistant",
        "A remote professional who handles administrative tasks - hire when your time is worth more than their cost",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A VA handles: email management, scheduling, research, data entry, social media, customer service, bookkeeping. Cost: $5-50/hour depending on skills/location. Hire when: (1) You're doing work worth less than your hourly rate, (2) Tasks are repeatable/trainable, (3) You're working IN your business, not ON it. Start 5-10 hours/week with clear SOPs."
