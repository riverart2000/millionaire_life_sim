      "text": "What is zero-based budgeting?",
      "options": [
        "Starting with zero savings",
        "Allocating every dollar of income to a specific category until income minus expenses equals zero",
        "Having no budget at all",
        "Spending everything you earn"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Zero-based budgeting means you give every dollar a job before the month begins. Income minus expenses should equal zero - not because you spend everything, but because you've allocated funds to savings, investments, and expenses. This ensures intentional money management."

      "text": "What is the envelope budgeting system?",
      "options": [
        "Hiding cash in envelopes",
        "Physical or digital 'envelopes' for each spending category with set amounts",
        "Mailing bills in envelopes",
        "Investing in paper products"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The envelope system involves dividing your spending money into categories (groceries, entertainment, gas) and allocating a specific amount to each 'envelope.' Once an envelope is empty, you stop spending in that category. This prevents overspending and builds discipline."

      "options": [
        "50% taxes, 30% bills, 20% fun",
        "50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings/debt",
        "50% investing, 30% spending, 20% giving",
        "50% stocks, 30% bonds, 20% cash"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The 50/30/20 rule allocates: 50% to needs (housing, food, utilities, transportation), 30% to wants (entertainment, dining out, hobbies), and 20% to savings and debt repayment. It's a simple framework for balanced money management."

      "options": [
        "Spending on luxuries before bills",
        "Automatically transferring money to savings/investments before spending on anything else",
        "Getting paid in cash",
        "Giving yourself a raise"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "'Pay yourself first' means treating savings and investments as your most important 'expense.' Set up automatic transfers to savings/investment accounts as soon as you get paid, before spending on anything else. This ensures wealth building becomes automatic."
