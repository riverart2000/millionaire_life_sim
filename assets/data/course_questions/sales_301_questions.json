        "Giving receipts to customers",
        "People feel obligated to give back when they receive something first - offering value creates debt",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Reciprocity (Cialdini): when you give first, people feel psychological debt to return the favor. Examples: free trials, valuable content, consultations, samples. The gift must be: (1) Unexpected, (2) Personalized, (3) Valuable. This creates goodwill and increases likelihood of purchase. Amazon's free shipping drives Prime subscriptions via reciprocity."

      "options": [
        "Avoiding losing weight",
        "People feel the pain of losing something twice as strongly as the pleasure of gaining it",
        "Being afraid of sales",
        "Getting lost"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Loss aversion: losing $100 hurts more than gaining $100 feels good. In sales, frame your solution around what they'll LOSE by not acting (time, money, opportunity, competitive edge) rather than only what they'll gain. Example: 'Every month without this, you're losing $5K to inefficiency' (pain) vs 'You'll save $5K' (gain)."

      "options": [
        "Having few products to sell",
        "People value things more when they're rare or limited - creates urgency through fear of missing out",
        "Being scarce in meetings",
        "Low inventory problems"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Scarcity increases perceived value. Types: (1) Limited quantity: 'Only 3 spots left,' (2) Limited time: '48-hour offer,' (3) Exclusive access: 'Invitation-only.' Must be genuine - false scarcity destroys trust. Works because of loss aversion and social proof (if others want it, it must be good). Use ethically, not manipulatively."

      "options": [
        "Dropping anchor on a boat",
        "The first number mentioned becomes the reference point for all following numbers",
        "Keeping prices stable",
        "Setting minimum prices"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Anchoring: the first price you see influences perception of value. Example: Show $10,000 option first, then $5,000 option feels reasonable. Or: 'Competitors charge $15K, we're $8K.' The $15K anchor makes $8K seem like a deal. Always anchor high when presenting options. Also works with value: 'This saves clients $50K annually' before mentioning $10K price."

        "Duck hunting",
        "Deceiving customers"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The decoy effect uses a third option to influence choice between two others. Example: Small coffee $3, Large $7 → Most buy Small. Add Medium $6.50 → Now Large seems like better value (+$0.50 for more coffee). The Medium is the 'decoy' - rarely purchased but makes Large attractive. Used in product tiers: Basic, Pro (decoy), Enterprise."
