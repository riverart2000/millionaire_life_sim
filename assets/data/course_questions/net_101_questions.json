      "options": [
        "Online vs in-person",
        "Strategic is intentional relationship-building with specific goals; casual is random social connection",
        "Business vs personal",
        "Formal vs informal"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Casual networking is attending events and collecting business cards randomly. Strategic networking is: (1) Identifying valuable connections aligned with your goals, (2) Researching them before meeting, (3) Offering value first, (4) Following up systematically, (5) Nurturing relationships long-term. Quality over quantity - 10 deep relationships beat 100 superficial ones."

      "text": "What is the 'give first' principle in networking?",
      "options": [
        "Always paying for lunch",
        "Offering value, help, or connections before asking for anything in return",
        "Giving business cards first",
        "Speaking first in meetings"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Give first means leading with generosity: make introductions, share knowledge, offer help, provide resources - without expecting immediate return. This: (1) Builds goodwill, (2) Activates reciprocity, (3) Demonstrates value, (4) Differentiates you. Ask: 'How can I help?' not 'What can you do for me?' Most networkers only take; givers build powerful networks."

      "options": [
        "Connect on all social media immediately",
        "Follow up within 24-48 hours with personalized message referencing your conversation",
        "Wait for them to reach out first",
        "Add them to your spam list"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The fortune is in the follow-up. Within 24-48 hours: (1) Send personalized message referencing specific conversation points, (2) Offer promised value/introduction, (3) Suggest specific next step if appropriate, (4) Connect on LinkedIn with custom note. Most people never follow up. Those who do systematically build powerful networks. Use CRM to track relationships."
