      "text": "What is the 'content distribution rule' often cited in marketing?",
      "options": [
        "100% creation, 0% promotion",
        "80% creation, 20% promotion",
        "20% creation, 80% promotion",
        "50% creation, 50% promotion"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The 80/20 rule suggests spending 20% of your time creating content and 80% promoting it. Many creators do the opposite, but great content without distribution won't reach anyone. Promotion through multiple channels is crucial for content marketing success."
