I am an excellent money manager.
I always pay myself first.
I put money into my Financial Freedom account everyday.
My money works hard for me and makes me more and more money,
I earn enough passive income to pay for my desired lifestyle.
I am financially free, I work because I choose to, not because I have to.
My part-time business is managing and investing my money and creating passive income streams.
I create my life. I create the exact amount of my financial success.
I play the money game to win. My intention is to create massive wealth and abundance.
I admire and model rich and successful people.
I believe money is important, money is freedom and money makes life more enjoyable.
I get rich doing what I love.
I deserve to be rich because I add massive value to other peoples lives.
I am a generous giver and an excellent receiver.
I am truly grateful for all the money I have right now.
Lucrative opportunities always come my way.
My capacity to earn, hold and grow money expands day-by-day.
I command my subconscious mind to align every thought, every action, and every ounce of my being to make me stronger, healthier and wiser then ever before, transforming me into a relentless money making machine as quickly and as efficiently as possible.
I deserve to be rich because I work extremely hard and am very productive.
